### What I learned

I learned how to work with the UI and Local Storage at the same time.
I also learned how to divide the work into small features and focus on each one step by step.

Through this project, I improved my ability to connect functions together, organize the project structure, and write cleaner, more maintainable code.
In addition, I learned how to effectively search documentation to find the information I need and apply it correctly
